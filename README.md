# Final project

Data-driven retail: business intelligence and AI-based predictive sales forecasts

### Introduction to the fictional story
Please consider the PowerPoint presentation (and notes within presentation!)


### Dataset description
Five CSV files from the Kaggle competition "Walmart Recruiting - Store Sales Forecasting" are available.

https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting/overview

##### Available Files:

Historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores in various regions is available. Each store contains a number of departments, and the task is to predict department-wide sales for each store.

Additionally, Walmart runs several promotional discount events throughout the year, which precede major holidays. The four biggest are the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.

##### stores.csv

This file contains anonymized information about the 45 stores, indicating the type and size of the store.

- Store: The store number (Primary Key)
- Type: The type of store (A, B, C)
- Size: The size of the store
- train.csv

These are the historical training data spanning from 02/05/2010 to 11/01/2012. This file contains the following fields:

- Store: The store number (Primary Key)
- Dept: The department number
- Date: The date of the respective week (Secondary Key)
- Weekly_Sales: Sales for the respective department in the respective store
- IsHoliday: Whether the week is a holiday week
- test.csv

This file is identical to train.csv, except the weekly sales are withheld. The task is to predict sales for each triplet of store, department, and date in this file.

##### features.csv

This file contains additional data related to the store, department, and regional activity for the given dates. It includes the following fields:

- Store: The store number (Primary Key)
- Date: The date of the respective week (Secondary Key)
- Temperature: The average temperature in the region
- Fuel_Price: Fuel prices in the region
- MarkDown1-5: Anonymized data related to promotional discounts run by Walmart. MarkDown data is only available after November 2011 and is not always available for all stores. Any missing value is marked as NA.
- CPI: The Consumer Price Index
- Unemployment: The unemployment rate
- IsHoliday: Whether the week is a holiday week
For simplicity, the four holidays fall within the following weeks in the dataset (not all holidays are included):
Super Bowl: February 12, 2010; February 11, 2011; February 10, 2012; February 8, 2013
Labor Day: September 10, 2010; September 9, 2011; September 7, 2012; September 6, 2013
Thanksgiving: November 26, 2010; November 25, 2011; November 23, 2012; November 29, 2013
Christmas: December 31, 2010; December 30, 2011; December 28, 2012; December 27, 2013

### Approach

- Develop a module to create individual charts for the app .
- Develop a module that train a XGBoost Model for forecasting.
- Develop a Streamlit app to visualize the charts and forecast. Parameters can be adjusted and passed to the two functions above to customize the analysis results.
  
Five Python files will be created: main.py, dashboard.py, preprocessing.py, time_series_analysis2.py and XGBoost.py.
- main.py: This file creates the Streamlit app and controls the function calls of the other files.
- dashboard.py: This file analyzes the sales data and visualizes it in the form of charts.
- XGBoost.py: In this file, a model will be trained and validated and sales forecasts are generated.

The final model evaluation will be based on MSE, MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² (coefficient of determination). These evaluation metrics will not only assess the model's accuracy but also check for overfitting or underfitting.
